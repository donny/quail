### Background

This project is part of [52projects](https://donny.github.io/52projects/) and the new stuff that I learn through this project: [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com)

### Serverless Framework

The [Serverless Framework](https://serverless.com) is an open-source, application framework to easily build serverless architectures on AWS Lambda and other platforms. Install the serverless command line tool: `npm install -g serverless`. We assume that the usual AWS credentials have been setup.

Create a service by running: `serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path helloWorldService`. Go to the `helloWorldService` directory and run: `serverless deploy`. This creates a CloudFormation stack and deploy an example function. We could invoke the function by running: `serverless invoke --function hello`. We could delete the service by running: `serverless remove`. This deletes the corresponding AWS services and destroy the CloudFormation stack.
